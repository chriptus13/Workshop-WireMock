# WireMock Workshop

This repository contains the files regarding WireMock workshop.

In the [Examples](/Examples/) folder you will find WireMock examples on how to run it and how to configure stubs (static/dynamic).

Then on the [MovieApp](/MovieApp/) there is a SpringBoot example application about movies which uses [TheMovieDataBase](https://developer.themoviedb.org) (TMDB) API. This app is used to exemplify the usage of WireMock and how you can quickly setup stubs having already some code/tests using real systems.
